Certainly, here's a simple readme for the task manager CLI code:
Task Manager CLI

The Task Manager CLI is a command-line tool written in Python that allows you to manage your tasks. You can add, list, and remove tasks using this simple utility.
Features

    Add a Task: Add a new task to your task list.

    List Tasks: View the list of tasks you have added.

    Remove Task: Remove a task from the list by specifying its index.

Usage

To use the Task Manager CLI, follow these instructions:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    Navigate to the Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the task_manager.py file.

    Run the CLI: Use the following commands to interact with the CLI:

        To add a task:

        bash

./task_manager.py --add "Buy groceries"

To list all tasks:

bash

./task_manager.py --list

To remove a task by index (replace [INDEX] with the actual index):

css

        ./task_manager.py --remove [INDEX]

    View and Manage Tasks: You can add, list, and remove tasks as needed.

    Data Persistence: The tasks are saved to a text file (tasks.txt) in the same directory, so they will persist between different runs of the CLI.

Dependencies

This CLI tool uses Python's built-in libraries and does not require any external dependencies.
